# Platformer Joystick

## TODO
- The readme
- Probably change default for per level
- Probably a level argument for default

Basically uh left and right are for player 1 left and right, while up and down are for player 2 left and right.

Also changes counter 3740 for horizontal and 3741 for vertical if a text object with "--joystick-counters" is found
